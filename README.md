- Original Data: 2013-2024 DATA
- Relevent dataset: Data produced while the code runs and the code necessary to run it.
- Note: 
    1. Because MedDRA is not publicly available, it is not included in this repository.
    2. When mapping Preferred Terms (PT) to System Organ Classes (SOC), some mappings proceed via intermediate hierarchy levels. Since MedDRA cannot be redistributed, I have provided a derived file with cluster labels in the relevant dataset: ae_to_soc_cluster.csv.
